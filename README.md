You stumble.

You shift your eyes downward, while simultaneously trying to register any movement, any artificial stillness, anything that seems <i>off</i>--360 degrees round your head. A large stone has been cast in your path. Do you kick it aside, nudge it gently, or go around it? Do you turn back and resolve to find a different route? Or decide to abandon your journey entirely? You glance ahead, and though you don't see many obstacles, you know they lie in wait, ready to materialize at the most inopportune moments, as you continue on your misssion toward equality.

How we deal with those obstacles determines the outcome. Not only for us, but for those who are affected by our work in the future.

My name is K, and I study successful and unsuccessful methods of navigating the seas of malcontent, of opposition, of marginalization, and of silencing. Because empowering people through communication is empowering people to do good for generations to come.
